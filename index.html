        <h3>Python</h3>
        <div class="about">
          <p>
            Python is a very popular language that offers career flexibility and a good basis for understanding the logic behind programming. 
            It is used by the likes of Facebook and Google, and many other big companies. Job opportunity galore! It also has one of the 
            highest average salaries behind Ruby and Matlab! But remember, most languages are lucrative and desirable skills so don’t let that 
            factor too much into your final choice! It is great for creating prototypes quickly, but is also used for more robust ventures like 
            machine learning and data science.

        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <div class="about">
          <p>
            Great for aspiring web developers. You seem like a great fit for front end design with your strong intuition and communication 
            skills. And while jQuery and Angular frameworks can help with client-side endeavors, NodeJS can also be used for any back-end programming. 
            This is one of the most sought after languages across the United States, so you could work almost anywhere! You'll be 
            able to create dynamic content, control multimedia, and be able to create everything you see on other websites. We suggest you 
            learn this one alongside HTML and CSS since JavaScript is commonly embedded into HTML code. If interactivity is your name, JavaScript 
            is your game!

          <p>
            C# is powerful and flexible, and able to make many different applications only limited by your own imagination. 
            With no constraints you can make anything from websites, developer tools, to compilers. It is just behind Java 
            when it comes to employer demand, so you'll be a highly sought-after candidate. Your creative energy is sure to 
            shine if you don't mind a bit of a challenge! It is also a great language for anyone hoping to work at Microsoft.
            Your emphasis on simplicity and efficiency makes you and C# a perfect match!
